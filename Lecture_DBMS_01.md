# DBMS (Data Base Management System)

## What is Data ?

* Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc.
* In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.
  Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in thecontext of computer storage and processing.
* Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed.collection of raw bits/bytes.

## What is Information?

* Information Is processed, organized, and structured data.
* It provides context of the data and enables decision making.
* Processed data that make sense to us.
* Information is extracted from the data, by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.
* E.g.,you have data of all the people living in your locality, its Data, when you analyze and interpret the data and come to some conclusion that:

  * There are 100 senior citizens.
  * The sex ratio is 1.1.
  * Newborn babies are 100.
  * These are information.

## Data vs Information

* Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.
* While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.
* Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a  big-picture view of how it all fits together.
* Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful  information.
* Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.
* Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is typically  presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.
* Data isn’t sufficient for **decision-making**, but you can make decisions based on information.

## Database

1. Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed,  managed, and updated.
2. To make real use Data, we need Database management systems. (DBMS)

## What is DBMS?

1. A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of  programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database,  contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to  store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
2. A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform  different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.

## DBMS vs File Systems

* File-processing systems has major disadvantages.
* Data Redundancy and inconsistency.
* Difficulty in accessing data
* Data isolation
* Integrity problems
* Atomicity problems
* Concurrent-access anomalies
* Security problems
